This is the repo for the collaborative project of Huteng Dai, Richard Futrell and Connor Mayer on modelling
phonotactics from large-scale corpus. We are currently testing our hypothesis on judgment data of English nonce words (Daland et al. 2011).

The goal of the study is to examine the role of natural classes in phonological learning. We ask: is it possible for a learner to acquire phonotactic grammar without prespecified featural system that is assumed in previous proposals. Moreover, is it possible to simultaneously induce a system of natural class and a phonotactic grammar?
